# Wealth-of-Nations
<p> This is the 1st project with the Just-IT bootcamp revolving around using excel to interact with the wealth of nations data set. </p>
<p> This project involved using various features of microsoft excel to clean and alter data, as well as filter the data and create graphs around specific queries. It also included some of the basics of making macros within excel as well as finally completing a report on the project. </p>
